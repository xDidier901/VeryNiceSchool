# VeryNiceSchool
Project made with .Net Framework, SQL Server MVC, EF Code-First and JQuery.

## How to run
Since this project is designed with code-first approach, the first time that you run the project **will create the database and insert data automatically** for you.

## Login
I created two users to test the project. 
* Username: user 
* Password: 1234 
* (Normal user)
--------------------------------
* Username: admin 
* Password: 4321 
* (Admin user)

The difference between these two is that the normal user only can see information, while the admin user can create, edit and delete as well.

## Scope
Since I had limited time to do this project, I only made CRUD operations for the Course entity. Instructors and Students are read-only at the moment.

Every time you add a new course, it **automatically adds random students**.

Made a very basic login just to add a little more.

My main focus was the architecture of the backend :+1:.
