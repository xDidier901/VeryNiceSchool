# VeryNiceSchool
Project made with .Net Framework, SQL Server MVC, EF Code-First and JQuery.

# How to run
Since this project is designed with code-first approach, the first time that you run the project will create the database and insert data automatically for you.

# Login
I created two users to test the project.
username: user
password: 1234
(Normal user)

username: admin
password: 4321
(Admin user)

The difference between these two is that the normal user can only see information, while the admin user can create, edit and delete.

# Scope
Since I had limited time to do this project, I only made CRUD operations for the Course entity. Instructors and Students are read-only at the moment.

Every time you add a new course, it automatically adds random students.

Made a very basic login just to add a little more.

My main focus was the architecture of the backend.
